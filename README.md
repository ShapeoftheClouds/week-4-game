### A fun and interactive game for web browsers, dynamically updated using HTML pages with the JQuery library.

There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

Clicking on a crystal will update the player's score counter.
The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number to match.
The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses.
